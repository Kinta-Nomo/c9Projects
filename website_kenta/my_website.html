                 <td align="center"><h3 style="font-size:200%;">Hello!!I AM PROGRAMMERRRRRR!!</h3><FONT FACE="algerian">The thought I always had in my mind was that programing language will 
                 gonna be very important when it is the time for the<br> 
                 robots to do everything for us.And that time will defenitely gonna come soon.<br>
                 few months before, I met the place called 'KidoCode' which is the place for me to learn programming language.<br>
                 And it was the best place ever in my life. The thing was that I loved 
                 the mathmatics so I obvioiusly enjoyed <br>the KidoCode but it was also a place for me to love-love with the teachers there.</font><br><br>
                 <FONT FACE="courier">The Boss of the KidoCode is UncleCode<br>
                 who was one of the worker in the Google and also the creater of KidoCode! the KidoCode is not only<br> about programming and I feel like it is the place to have conversation between the teachers.<br>
                 For example,there is three teachers who loves me and I often talks with them for a long time.<br> They sometimes teaches me  which is not even in the tasks so I can improve on 
                 what I need or like.<br>
                 I like the course called mit app inventor which is to create your own<br> mobile application and mainly because I love drawing and also custumizing my own stuffs.</FONT>
                 
                 
                 
                 </td>
                 <td><h3 style="font-size:200%;">Kidocode is the place for us to get ready for the <strong style="color:Red;"><em>future.</em></strong><br></h3>
                 As explained in the left paragraph,programmers will gonna be the most important job in the future.And I was looking<br> for the place to learn programming language for a months.And I found a perfect place called 'KidoCode'.<br>
                 I can say that the biggest and the best part of this class is how the teachers treat students.<br><br>
                 In KidoCode,we can learn many types of programmings,like Python,which is the most useful programming language<br> now,application creating,<font face="verdana" color="red">L</font><font face="verdana" color="green">E</font><font face="verdana" color="blue">D</font> light proggraming(including the sensor),rasberry pie and html.
                 The class works like this.<br><br>
                 <font face="verdana" color="green">1. at first,the students are given their own google account and a password for them to login into the kidocode<br> website.So when the student arrives at the kidocode, they will gonna open the computer and login to their
                 kidocode account<br> to get the tasks they have in their list.<br><br>
                 2. the class has no schedule made and students can work on any task they want.So if she or he wants to make a mobile <br>application,they will start the application tasks.<br><br>
                 3. as the schedule is not made, the students can also enjoy their own time in the kidocode.For example,they can eat donuts<br>,watch youtube or even sleep!They can also listen to the music while they are working on their tasks.<br><br>
                 4. if the students completed all the tasks, they can work on their own tasks.Like creating their own original codes in python.</font><br><br>
